## What is HTTP?

**HTTP** (_Hypertext Transfer Protocol_) is a protocol for communication on the web.

It is a web **application layer protocol** that uses the **TCP protocol**. It is used as the **client/server model**, with requests and responses. It follows the **client-server model**, with **requests** and **responses**.

HTTP is **stateless**, meaning the server **does not maintain information about the client.** Consequently, each request must contain all the necessary information for the server to handle it independently.

When data is sent encrypted over HTTP, the **HTTPS** protocol (_Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure_) is used. HTTPS is secured by **SSL/TLS**.

When a client makes an HTTP request to the server, a "**method**" (_or verb_) is attached to it. These methods provide a **standardized way to structure requests** based on their context. The four main methods are:

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
- **POST**: Inserts new data to the server.
- **PUT**: Updates data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Deletes data from the server.

HTTP requests and responses structure consist of a **body** and a **header**. The body could be the HTML that the server responds with or a form that the client sends, for example.

A JSON response example:

```json
 {
   "name": "John Doe",
   "user": "johndoe_warlock_master",
 }
```

Headers are divided into general, response and request headers (_general headers are the ones that belongs to both request and response_). They contain **information and configuration details** about an HTTP communication.

A request HTTP example with headers:

```
> GET / HTTP/2
> Host: google.com
> user-agent: insomnia/8.6.1
> accept: */*
```

A response HTTP example with headers:

```
< HTTP/2 301 
< location: https://www.google.com/
< content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< content-security-policy-report-only: object-src 'none'
< date: Fri, 26 Jul 2024 00:56:58 GMT
< expires: Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:56:58 GMT
< cache-control: public, max-age=2592000
< server: gws
< content-length: 220
< x-xss-protection: 0
< x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
< alt-svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
```

While many headers may not be necessary for everyday use, some are particularly important. The Status Code header provides information about the status of the HTTP communication. The server can inform the client whether a request was successful by the status code it returns. These codes are divided into ranges, each representing different types of responses:

- 1xx: Informational
- 2xx: Success
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client Error
- 5xx: Server Error

Some examples include:
- 200: OK
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error
